# MiniGit
In this project I implemented my own simplified version of a version control system similar to Git, using linked lists. When comparing my approach to this program using an ArrayList instead of Linked List, I think I would prefer a ListNode type of approach. I'm honestly not too keen on the differences of pros and cons of using ArrayLists or LinkedLists beside the fact that ArrayLists are contiguous and LInkedLists are not. I think using A non-contiguous approach to this problem made the overall solution easier. The whole time we are basically keeping one reference to the repo that is made. I think if we had used ArrayLists keeping track of them all would've been a little bit more work. I think this because my initial approach to this program were to use things like Maps and sets. I realize this doesn't really work with non-contiguous data. Problems had come up while thinking about how to deal with references when using Maps and Sets and that's when I realized I was approaching the problem wrong.
